Officially known as the City and County of Cardiff, it is the United Kingdom's eleventh-largest city and the main commercial centre of Wales. Cardiff is the base for the Senedd, most national cultural institutions and the Welsh media. At the 2011 census, the unitary authority area population was estimated to be 346,090, and the wider urban area 479,000. In 2011, Cardiff was sixth in the world in the National Geographic magazine's list of alternative tourist destinations. Cardiff is the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 21.3\u00a0million visitors in 2017.\nCardiff is the county town of the historic county of Glamorgan, and, since 1974, South Glamorgan. Cardiff is part of the Eurocities network of the largest European cities. A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a major port for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city. In 1905, Cardiff was made a city and proclaimed the capital of Wales in 1955. In the 2011 Census, the population was 346,100. The Cardiff Built-up Area covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary and includes the towns of Dinas Powys and Penarth.\nSince the 1980s, Cardiff has seen significant development. A new waterfront area at Cardiff Bay contains the Senedd building (the Welsh Parliament) and the Wales Millennium Centre arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the Cardiff International Sports Village, the BBC drama village, and a new business district in the city centre.\nSporting venues in the city include the Principality Stadium\u2014the national stadium and the home of the Wales national rugby union team\u2014Sophia Gardens (the home of Glamorgan County Cricket Club), Cardiff City Stadium (the home of Cardiff City football team and the Wales football team), Cardiff International Sports Stadium (the home of Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club), Cardiff Arms Park (the home of Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC rugby union teams) and Ice Arena Wales (the home of Cardiff Devils ice hockey team). The city hosted the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Cardiff was awarded European City of Sport due to its role in hosting major international sporting events in 2009 and again in 2014. The Principality Stadium hosted 11 football matches as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics, including the games' opening event and the men's bronze medal match.", "r_dbid": "62daec64ee14d50331421b22", "r_user": "Ealdgyth", "s_page": "Cardiff", "s_revid": "7511072", "s_content": "Cardiff is the capital and biggest city of Wales, in the United Kingdom.

The only president to resign the office, Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961.\nNixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. After completing his undergraduate work at Whittier College, he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937, and returned to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942. He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II. Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962. In 1968, he ran again for the presidency and was elected.\nAlthough Nixon initially escalated America's involvement in the Vietnam War, he subsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated d\u00e9tente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other things, he initiated wars on cancer and drugs, imposed wage and price controls, enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency. Though he presided over Apollo 11, he scaled back manned space exploration. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972.\nNixon's second term saw an Arab oil embargo, the resignation of his vice president, Spiro Agnew, and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he was controversially issued a pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford. In retirement, Nixon's work as an elder statesman, authoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips, helped to rehabilitate his public image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.

"r_content": "A village is a human settlement commonly found in rural areas. It is usually larger than a hamlet and smaller than a town or city. Villages have been the normal unit of community living in most areas of the world throughout its history, up until the Industrial revolution and the ongoing process of urbanization. In many U.S. states, a village is a type of municipal government (see below).\nAlthough many types and organizational patterns of village life have existed, the typical village was small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families. Homes were situated together for sociability and defense, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed.\nIn England the main historical distinction between a hamlet and a village is that the latter will have a church, and will therefore usually have been the worship centre of a parish. A village is traditionally distinguished from a town because a village lacks a regular market.\nThere is much dispute over which is the largest village in England. Places claiming to be the largest include Cranleigh in Surrey, Cottingham in the East Riding of Yorkshire, both Haddenham and Wendover in Buckinghamshire, Braunton in Devon, Birchington in Kent, Horsforth in West Yorkshire, Street in Somerset, Bembridge on the Isle of Wight, Ruskington in Lincolnshire and Kidlington in Oxfordshire.\nIn many parts of the United States, for example New York and Vermont, the term \"village\" refers to a specific form of incorporated local government, similar to a city but with less authority and geographic scope. However, this is a generality; in many states such as Illinois, there are villages that are an order of magnitude larger than the smallest cities in the state. The distinction is not based on population, but on the relative powers granted to the different types of municipalities and correspondingly, different obligations to provide specific services to residents. Villages in New York are often physically within a town and may be coterminous with it, but in other cases may be in two towns or even two counties). In some other parts of the U.S., a \"village\" is simply a populated place, with no legal standing or charter, as is a hamlet in New York.", "r_dbid": "62d0ab0d1bbc6dcde5b187ca", "r_user": "MisfitToys", "s_page": "Village", "s_revid": "16237", "s_content": "A village is a place where people live, normally in the countryside.

It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701\u20131744), who developed a similar temperature scale two years before his death. The degree Celsius (\u00b0C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. The unit was known until 1948 as centigrade.\nFrom 1744 until 1954, 0\u00a0\u00b0C was defined as the freezing point of water and 100\u00a0\u00b0C was defined as the boiling point of water, both at a pressure of one standard atmosphere with mercury being the working material Although these defining correlations are commonly taught in schools today, by international agreement the unit \"degree Celsius\" and the Celsius scale are currently defined by two different points: absolute zero, and the triple point of VSMOW (specially prepared water). This definition also precisely relates the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale, which defines the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature (symbol: K). Absolute zero, the hypothetical but unattainable temperature at which matter exhibits zero entropy, is defined as being precisely 0\u00a0K and \u2212273.15\u00a0\u00b0C. The temperature value of the triple point of water is defined as being precisely 273.16\u00a0K and 0.01\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThis definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree Celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16 parts, the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water.

Some species of bacteria secrete it to form biofilms.\nCellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33 percent of all plant matter is cellulose (the cellulose content of cotton is 90 percent and that of wood is 50 percent).\nFor industrial use, cellulose is mainly obtained from wood pulp and cotton.

A location's position along a circle of latitude is given by its longitude.\nCircles of latitude are often called parallels because they are parallel to each other \u2013 that is, any two parallels are everywhere the same distance apart. Unlike Circle of longitudes, which all are Great circles with the centre of Earth in its middle, the Circles of latitude gets shorter and shorter away from the Equator. Due to the daily Earth rotation, the planet isn't a full sphere (not even at sea level). But the ovality of Earth is less than 0.3\u00a0%, i.o.w the Earth radius at the poles are approximately 0.3% shorter than the Earth radius at the equator. But the main reason the Circles of latitude becomes shorter towards the poles, is the fact that they are not Great Circles. Their length can be calculated by a common Sine or Cosine function. The 60th latitude is where a the circle of latitude is half as long as the equator, if disregasrding from the minor Earth ovality. Whithin navigation on oceans as well as within aviation, the elliptically of Earth is of no concern at all. Many maps do though picture its covering area, from world wide and down to much smaller areas, as if the length between (each integer) parallel to be longer toward the poles, this hasn't anything to do with Earth's elliptical shape though, but is a necessety when making perpendicular maps. A perpendicular map has the advantage of having correct angles, but at high latitudes, everything is horizontally stretched out and the poles (which in reality are dimensionless dots) are stretched to the lenght of the equator. Other type of maps may be more true when comparing sizes, but instead becomes untrue to f.i. compass headings. In general all (two dimentional) maps lie in one way or another, this comes down to the simple fact that Earth isn't flat, but (almost) a sphere. Typically Greenland appears to be covering a larger area than Australia, but on a globe the real proportions between these two areas are revealed. On some map projections, like the equirectangular projection, they are drawn equidistant.)\nCircles of latitude become smaller the farther they are from the equator and the closer they are to the poles. A circle of latitude is perpendicular to all meridians, and is hence a special case of a loxodrome.\nThe latitude of the circle is (roughly) the angle between the equator and the circle, with the angle's vertex at the Earth's centre. The equator is at 0\u00b0, and the North and South Pole are at 90\u00b0 north and 90\u00b0 south respectively. The Equator is the longest Circle of latitudes and is the only circle of latitude which also is a great circle. There are 89 integral (whole degree) circles of latitude between the equator and the Poles in each hemisphere, but these can be divided into more precise measurements of latitude, and are often represented as a decimal degree (e.g. 34.637\u00b0N) or with minutes and seconds (e.g. 22\u00b014'26\"S). There is no limit to how precisely latitude can be measured, and so there are an infinite number of circles of latitude on Earth. Arcs of circles of latitude are sometimes used as boundaries between countries or regions where distinctive natural borders are lacking (such as in deserts), or when an artificial border is drawn as a \"line on a map\", which was made in massive scale during the 1888 Berlin Conference, regarding uge parts of the African continent. Also the North American nations and states have mostly been created by straight lines, which often are parts of circles of latitudes. For instance does the northern and southern borders of Colorado equal the 41st and 37th northern latitudes and a abouth half the bordet between United States and Canada follows the 49th northern latitude.", "r_dbid": "62db1f17ee14d50331779b89", "r_user": "Boeing720", "s_page": "Circle of latitude", "s_revid": "462564", "s_content": "On the Earth, a circle of latitude is an imaginary east-west circle that connects all locations with a given latitude.

Various guns and cannons have been used in this role since the first military aircraft were used in World War I, growing in power and accuracy over the years. Starting in the post-World War II era the guns were joined by the guided missile, specifically the \"surface-to-air missile\", and today both are used in combination in most roles. Adaptations of standard artillery systems were commonly used for most long-range anti-aircraft artillery, starting with standard pieces on new mountings, and evolving to custom guns with much higher performance prior to World War II. Their shells are usually fitted with different types of fuses (barometric, time-delay, or proximity) to send exploding metal fragments into the area of the target. The classic example of a large calibre, long-range anti-aircraft gun is the German 88 mm gun. Long-range weapons of this sort have for the most part been superseded by the effective anti-air missile systems that were introduced in the 1950s; however, because they are relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture compared to more modern systems, they are still employed in large numbers by many nations.\nFor shorter-range work, a lighter weapon with a higher rate of fire is required, to guarantee a hit on a quickly traversing target. Weapons of 20 mm, 37 mm, and 40 mm have been widely used in this role. Unlike the heavier guns, these smaller weapons are still in widespread use today for the same reasons as they were originally introduced: the ability to quickly follow the target. Modern systems often use weapons generally known as autocannon, that were originally intended for air-to-ground use. However, developments in the latest short-range missiles means that these appear to be able to replace guns even in this role.\nNicknames for anti-aircraft guns include AAA or triple-A, an abbreviation for anti-aircraft artillery, ack-ack (from the World War I phonetic alphabet for AA), archie (a WWI British term believed to derive via the Royal Flying Corps from the music-hall comedian George Robey's line \"Archibald, certainly not!\"), and flak or flack (from the German Flugabwehrkanone, aircraft defense cannon).[ An anti-aircraft missile is another name for a surface-to-air missile, abbreviated and pronounced SAM.\nThe United States Navy uses the term Anti-Air Warfare (AAW); most groups of ships have a designated AAW commander among them. The Soviet Anti-Air Defense was a separate armed service, but in Russia has been subordinated to the Air Force. The United States Army has generally been able to count on air superiority to reduce the threat from air attack on its ground units, and settles for a two-tier structure: the man-portable Stinger missile (fired by troops or from vehicles) and the anti-aircraft/anti-missile Patriot system. Countries less assured of air superiority have more tiers. Russia, for example, has a system consisting of battalion-level MANPADS, regimental SHORAD (typically autocannon and IR/SACLOS SAMs), divisional SHORAD (typically short-ranged radar guided SAMs), medium range Army level (SA-11) and long range Front level (SA-12) systems.", "r_dbid": "62d0acba1bbc6dcde5b776d3", "r_user": "Rillian", "s_page": "Anti-aircraft warfare", "s_revid": "509832", "s_content": "Anti-aircraft warfare, or air defence, is any way of fighting military aircraft in combat from the ground.

Sickle-cell anaemia is also referred to as \"HbSS\", \"SS disease\", \"haemoglobin S\" or permutations thereof. In heterozygous people, who have only one sickle gene and one normal adult haemoglobin gene, it is referred to as \"HbAS\" or \"sickle cell trait\". Other, rarer forms of sickle-cell disease include sickle-haemoglobin C disease (HbSC), sickle beta-plus-thalassaemia (HbS/\u03b2+) and sickle beta-zero-thalassaemia (HbS/\u03b20). These other forms of sickle-cell disease are compound heterozygous states in which the person has only one copy of the mutation that causes HbS and one copy of another abnormal haemoglobin allele.\nThe term disease is applied, because the inherited abnormality causes a pathological condition that can lead to death and severe complications.

This allows the computer's control circuitry to issue instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to perform all steps at once. The term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying data at once (like water), and each step is connected to the next (like the links of a pipe.)\nThe origin of pipelining is thought to be either the ILLIAC II project or the IBM Stretch project. The IBM Stretch Project proposed the terms, \"Fetch, Decode, and Execute\" that became common usage.\nMost modern CPUs are driven by a clock. The CPU consists internally of logic and memory (flip flops). When the clock signal arrives, the flip flops take their new value and the logic then requires a period of time to decode the new values. Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops again take their new values, and so on. By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between the pieces of logic, the delay before the logic gives valid outputs is reduced. In this way the clock period can be reduced.

There are several possible disadvantages. An instruction pipeline is said to be fully pipelined if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle. A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline.\nAdvantages of Pipelining:\nDisadvantages of Pipelining:", "r_dbid": "62d0ae461bbc6dcde5bce4e1", "r_user": "218.248.46.85", "s_page": "Instruction pipelining", "s_revid": "1144080", "s_content": "An instruction pipeline is a technique used in the design of modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and CPUs to increase their instruction throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time).\nThe main idea is to divide (termed \"split\") the processing of a computer instruction, as defined by the instruction microcode, into a series of independent steps (called \"microinstructions\", \"micro-op\" or \"\u00b5op\"), with storage at the end of each step. This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step. The term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstructions (like a drop of water), and each step is linked to another step (analogy; similar to water pipes).\nMost modern CPUs are driven by a clock. The CPU consists internally of logic and memory (flip flops). When the clock signal arrives, the flip flops store their new value then the logic requires a period of time to decode the flip flops new values. Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops store another values, and so on. By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between the pieces of logic, the delay from the logic start decodes values till generating valid outputs is reduced.

The Falls are crossed by a narrow, multi-arched stone bridge carrying the main A827 road into Killin.\nKillin railway station was on the Killin Railway. The station was officially closed on 1 November 1965.\nThe MacNab Clan were once dominant here, and have long been associated with Killin. Their ancient burial ground is on Inchbuie in the River Dochart, just below the Falls, and is visible from the bridge. Kinnell House was the seat of the MacNabs. A well preserved prehistoric standing stone circle (possibly 'restored' to improve its appearance) can be seen in the grounds of the House. To the north of the village lie the ruins of the Campbells of Breadalbane stronghold of Finlarig Castle, with its associated chapel. The growing power of the Campbells eventually ousted the MacNabs, who lost Kinnell House to their rivals. In 1694 Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy, 1st Earl of Breadalbane established Killin as a Burgh of barony.\nBy the end of the 18th century there was a local linen industry. Flax was grown locally, spun in small mills and woven into linen by home based weavers. Today, Killin services the local rural community and the growing tourism and leisure industries. In addition to walking on Ben Lawers, fishing for trout and salmon there are various watersports available on Loch Tay. Many local vernacular buildings have been preserved or converted, allowing the village to retain much of its historic character.\nThe 19th century Moirlanich Longhouse in nearby Glen Lochay is a rare surviving example of the cruck frame Scottish longhouse, and is now in the care of the National Trust for Scotland.

In 1977 he played for Independiente Rivadavia, but returned to Ferro the next season. With Ferro he obtained the first division Nacional 1982 and Nacional 1984. He also played for the Argentina national football team, but didn't participate in the World Cup. In 1988 he transferred to Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n, were he played until his retirement in 1992.\nC\u00faper started his coaching career in Hurac\u00e1n, a year and a half after his retirement. After three years he moved to Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas, and two years later he made the jump to Europe. In 1997 he was hired by RCD Mallorca, and in the very first season he drove the modest club to the final of the Copa del Rey, which he would lose against FC Barcelona. The following season the team reached the final of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup losing to S.S. Lazio. However, in the same season the team had its revenge against Barcelona, winning the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a in 1998. That season also meant the best historical position at the end of the league with a 3rd place, allowing the team to play in the UEFA Champions League.\nC\u00faper moved to the Valencia CF in 1999, where he maintained his bad luck in finals, losing the final of the Champions League two consecutive times; in 2000 against Real Madrid, and in 2001 with FC Bayern Munich by penalty kicks.\nIn 2001 C\u00faper was hired by Italian club Inter Milan, where he reached the third and second place of the championship in successive seasons. His poor luck with champions league continued when his team lost the semifinals of UEFA Champions League 2002-03 to city rivals A.C. Milan on away goals rule. He was fired from the club after six matches in 2003, when the team was in the 8th position.\nAfter a year off work, due to a contractual argument with Inter, C\u00faper managed Mallorca again during the 2004/05 season, when the team was already in a relegation position after 10 matches, saving the team from relegation in the last match of the season. Suffering bad results in spite of his many signings, C\u00faper decided to leave the team in February 2006, with the team at the bottom of the division.\nHe started the 2007\u201308 season at the helm of Real Betis, but was sacked on December 2, 2007 following his side's loss against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.

O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role as the reanimated mummy. It is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name which starred Boris Karloff in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the movie was eventually turned into a blockbuster adventure film with horror themes.\nFilming began in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.\nThe Mummy opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43\u00a0million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; the movie went on to gross $416 million worldwide.

Stephen Sommers was the person who wrote it and directed it. It has Brendan Fraser (as Rick O'Connell, a person who seeks treasure), and Rachel Weisz (as Evelyn 'Evie' Carnahan, a person who studies Egypt) and Arnold Vosloo who plays the Mummy. The film has a lot of talking in the old Egyptian language, which was spoken with the help of a group of people who study it for their job. It was based on the 1932 movie of the same name which had Boris Karloff in the title role. It was first going to be to be part of a few low-cost horror movies but was later given the money to be a big Hollywood movie.\nThe Mummy showed for the first time on May 7, 1999, and brought in $43\u00a0million in 3,210\u00a0theaters in that weekend and then went on to bring in$415\u00a0million worldwide. The first movie led to another in 2001 called The Mummy Returns, as well as The Mummy: The Animated Series, and The Scorpion King.

Methanol acquired the name \"wood alcohol\" because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood. Modern methanol is produced in a catalytic industrial process directly from carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\nMethanol is the simplest alcohol, and is a light, volatile, colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol (drinking alcohol). However, unlike ethanol, methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption. At room temperature, it is a polar liquid, and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethanol. It is also used for producing biodiesel via transesterification reaction.\nMethanol is produced naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria, and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment. As a result, there is a small fraction of methanol vapor in the atmosphere. Over the course of several days, atmospheric methanol is oxidized with the help of sunlight to carbon dioxide and water.\nMethanol burns in oxygen, including open air, forming carbon dioxide and water:\nMethanol ingested in large quantities is metabolized to formic acid or formate salts, which is poisonous to the central nervous system, and may cause blindness, coma, and death. Because of these toxic properties, methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses.

Basic English is, in essence, a simplified subset of regular English. It was presented in Ogden's book Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar (1930).\nOgden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in World War II as a means for world peace. Ogden was convinced that the world needed to gradually eradicate minority languages and use as much as possible only one, English in either a simple or complete form. A widely known 1933 book on this is a science fiction work on history up to the year 2016 titled \"The Shape of Things to Come\" by H. G. Wells. In this work Basic English is the inter-language of the future world, a world in which after long struggles a global authoritarian government manages to unite humanity and force everyone to learn it as a second language.\nAlthough Basic English was not built into a program, similar simplifications have been devised for various international uses. Ogden's associate I. A. Richards promoted its use in schools in China. More recently, it has influenced the creation of Voice of America's Special English for news broadcasting, and Simplified Technical English, another English-based controlled language designed to write technical manuals.\nWhat survives today of Ogden's Basic English is the basic 850-word list used as the beginner's vocabulary of the English language taught worldwide, especially in Asia.", "r_dbid":

The stadium can seat 150,000, which is the largest non-auto racing stadium capacity in the world.\nIts name comes from Rungra Island in the Taedong River, upon which it is situated, and May Day, the international day celebrating labour and particularly celebrated among communists. Its scalloped roof features 16 arches arranged in a ring, and it is said to resemble a parachute or a magnolia blossom. It is not to be confused with the nearby large Kim Il-sung Stadium.\nIt hosts events on a main pitch sprawling across over 22,500\u00a0m\u00b2 (242,200\u00a0ft\u00b2).

These performances are now an annual feature in Pyongyang, usually in August and September. The Guinness Book of Records has recognized these events as the largest in the world.\nIt was also the venue in which Kim Jong-Il in 2000 entertained Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton.\nAt the end of the 1990s, a number of North Korean army generals implicated in an assassination attempt on Kim Jong-il were executed by being burned alive in the stadium.", "r_dbid": "62d3724c11049d02262affce", "r_user": "59.13.202.14", "s_page": "Rungrado May Day Stadium", "s_revid": "2296633", "s_content": "The R\u016dngrado May First Stadium, or May Day Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea, completed on May 1, 1989.\nThe stadium was built as a main stadium for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989.\nIt is currently used for football matches, a few athletics matches, but most often for Arirang performances (also known as the Mass Games).

It is the first installment in The Hangover trilogy. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Heather Graham, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, and Jeffrey Tambor. It tells the story of Phil Wenneck (Cooper), Stu Price (Helms), Alan Garner (Galifianakis), and Doug Billings (Bartha), who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate Doug's impending marriage. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and no memory of the previous night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place.\nLucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club. After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for $2\u00a0million, Phillips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer Mike Tyson. Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days, and during filming, the three main actors (Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis) formed a real friendship.\nThe Hangover was released on June 5, 2009, and was a critical and commercial success. The film became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2009, with a worldwide gross of over $467\u00a0million. The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, and received multiple other accolades. It is the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever in the United States at the time (before its sequel broke the record), surpassing a record previously held by Beverly Hills Cop for almost 25 years.\nA sequel, The Hangover Part II, was released on May 26, 2011, and a third and final installment, The Hangover Part III, was released on May 23, 2013.

In 1992, she auditioned for the lead role as Tiffani, but lost out to Kelly Packard. However, the incident led to them being best friends till this day.In that same year, she also appeared in an episode of Beverly Hills 90210. In January 1993, she began performing the role as Kim in Chicago's production of Miss Saigon. Later that year, the producers of California Dreams called her back to join the main cast, playing the role of Sam, a foreign exchange student. Kwan replaced Heidi Noelle Lenhart (who, coincidentally, played the role of \"Jenny\") in the main cast and remained with the show until its cancellation in 1997.\nDuring that year, Jennie appeared as a guest star on Family Matters, playing a snooty sorority girl, and on The Nanny, playing Mai Ling, Fran's Unicef foster daughter. She also starred in the role of \"Trish\" in the film Trojan War.\nIn addition, Kwan played the role of student Diane in the Los Angeles production of musical Bare, a Pop Opera as well as a starring role in the one-woman play, Faces of America and the online series Fear of a Punk Planet.\nIn 2001, Jennie left acting for a while to join the girl group Nobody's Angel. However, with its popularity quickly declining, the group split up just one year later.\nJennie returned to acting in 2005, when she played the role of female warrior Suki on the Asian-influenced animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender. She starred in the Las Vegas original cast of the musical \"Avenue Q\", and spent time starring in the national tour as an understudy for the role of Christmas Eve.

Trait theorists are primarily interested in the measurement of traits, which can be defined as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. According to this perspective, traits are relatively stable over time, differ among individuals (e.g. some people are outgoing whereas others are shy), and influence behavior.\nGordon Allport was an early pioneer in the study of traits, which he sometimes referred to as dispositions. In his approach, central traits are basic to an individual's personality, whereas secondary traits are more peripheral. Common traits are those recognized within a culture and may vary between cultures. Cardinal traits are those by which an individual may be strongly recognized. Since Allport's time, trait theorists have focused more on group statistics than on single individuals. Allport called these two emphases \"nomothetic\" and \"idiographic,\" respectively.\nThere is a nearly unlimited number of potential traits that could be used to describe personality. The statistical technique of factor analysis, however, has demonstrated that particular clusters of traits reliably correlate together. Cattell's personality factors are unique among competing descriptions in that they are not based on any psychological or biological theoretical model of what should be or are major factors in human personality but are claimed to empirically be what is actually extracted from observable measures which were collected with no preconceived hypothesis about what might be expected.\nCattell's factoral analysis \"found\" these factors, and only after finding them did he attempt assign names and meanings to them.\nCite error: A <ref> tag is missing the closing </ref> (see the help page).

Other ants then extract nourishment from them. They function as living larders. Honeypot ants belong to any of five genera, including Myrmecocystus. They were first documented in 1881 by Henry C. McCook.\nMany insects, notably honey bees and some wasps, collect and store liquid for use at a later date. However, these insects store their food within their nest or in combs. Honey ants are unique in using their own bodies as living storage, but they have more function than just storing food. Some store liquids, body fat, and water from insect prey brought to them by worker ants. They can later serve as a food source for their fellow ants when food is otherwise scarce. When the liquid stored inside a honeypot ant is needed, the worker ants stroke the antennae of the honeypot ant, causing the honeypot ant to regurgitate the stored liquid. In certain places such as the Australian Outback, honeypot ants are eaten by aboriginal people as sweets and are considered a delicacy. Some worker ants turn into honeypots right from their emergence from pupa stage. The young ants stay in the nest, and the worker ants who collect honey feed them. As they feed more honey than they need, the surplus honey gets stored in their abdomen. As their abdomen expand, the ants lose their mobility.\nThese ants can live anywhere in the nest, but in the wild, they are found deep underground, literally imprisoned by their huge abdomens, swollen to the size of grapes. They are so valued in times of little food and water that occasionally raiders from other colonies, knowing of these living storehouses, will attempt to steal these ants because of their high nutritional value and water content. These ants are also known to change colors. Some common colors are green, red, orange, yellow, and blue.\nHoneypot ants such as Camponotus inflatus are edible and form an occasional part of the diet of various Australian Aboriginal peoples. Papunya, in Australia's Northern Territory is named after a honey ant creation story, or Dreaming, which belongs to the people there, such as the Warlpiri. The name of Western Desert Art Movement, Papunya Tula, means \"honey ant dreaming\".\nMyrmecocystus nests are found in a variety of arid or semi-arid environments. Some species live in extremely hot deserts, others reside in transitional habitats, and still other species can be found in woodlands where it is somewhat cool but still very dry for a large part of the year.", "r_dbid": "62d1f15170a3472b80916d9f", "r_user": "174.53.229.28", "s_page": "Honeypot ant", "s_revid": "4376814", "s_content": "Honeypot ants (also called honey ants or repletes) are ants with swelled abdomens.

The name means \"white rock\" in Portuguese, and refers to whitish guano (bird droppings) deposited on the rock. The island consists of a small outcrop of granite rocks with an area of about 8,560 square metres (92,100\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). During the low water spring tide it measures, at its longest, 137 metres (449\u00a0ft) and has an average width of 60 metres (200\u00a0ft). It is situated at 1\u00b0 19\u2032 48\u2033 N and 104\u00b0 24\u2032 27\u2033 E, where the Singapore Strait meets the South China Sea. There are two maritime features near Pedra Branca. Middle Rocks, under the sovereignty of Malaysia, consists of two clusters of small rocks about 250 metres (820\u00a0ft) apart situated 0.6 nautical miles (1.1\u00a0km; 0.7\u00a0mi) south of Pedra Branca. South Ledge, which is 2.2 nautical miles (4.1\u00a0km; 2.5\u00a0mi) to the south-south-west of Pedra Branca, is a rock formation visible only at low-tide.\nPedra Branca was known to sailors for centuries. It was originally within the territory of the Johor Sultanate which was founded in 1528, and remained under the new Sultanate of Johor under the British sphere of influence following the signing of the Anglo\u2013Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Between 1850 and 1851, the British built Horsburgh Lighthouse on the island without informing the Johor authorities of their decision to do so or seeking consent for its erection. From that time, the island was administered by the United Kingdom and its successor, Singapore. On 21 September 1953, the Acting State Secretary of Johor, responding to a query from the Colonial Secretary of Singapore about the status of the island, stated that \"the Johore Government does not claim ownership of Pedra Branca\".\nOn 21 December 1979 Malaysia published a map which showed the island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together with the issue of sovereignty over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, was presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty. Although the island had originally been under the sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of sovereignty in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions which demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's sovereignty over the island, meant that Singapore had gained sovereignty over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of sovereignty in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.", "r_dbid": "62d10d4911049d02261d6c74", "r_user": "Chelva28", "s_page": "Pedra Branca, Singapore", "s_revid": "4383883", "s_content": "Pedra Branca, also known as Pulau Batu Puteh and Batu Puteh, is an small island at the western edge of the South China Sea.

The album is made up of eight remixes from Jackson's previous studio album HIStory, and five new songs. Jackson was heavily involved with the production of the new material while the remixes were produced by other artists. The new material dealt with themes such as drug addiction, women and paranoia. The album received minimal promotion by Jackson's standards, particularly in the US. Still, a film, two singles (\"Blood on the Dance Floor\" and \"HIStory/Ghosts\") and three music videos were issued as promotion. Reviews at the time of release were largely mixed, some critics felt that Jackson had already explored these musical themes while others criticized what they perceived as weak vocals. Other critics were favorable, with praise issued for similarities to the music of Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor. Since its debut, the album has sold an estimated six million copies worldwide, making it the best selling remix album ever released. Where is the source? Nowhere to be seen. As usual, Michael Jackson fans overstating his numbers without any source.

At Rutgers University, he was an outstanding football player, then had an international career in singing, as well as acting in theater and movies. He became politically involved in response to the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and social injustices. His advocacy of anti-imperialism, affiliation with communism, and his criticism of the US government caused him to be blacklisted during McCarthyism. Ill health forced him into retirement from his career. He remained an advocate of many radical political stances, such as support for eradicating lynching and supporting newly liberated societies among socialistic lines, until his death.\nRobeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers University, where he became a football All-American and the class valedictorian. He received his LL.B. from Columbia Law School, while playing in the National Football League (NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions and, after graduating, he became a participant in the Harlem Renaissance with performances in The Emperor Jones and All God's Chillun Got Wings. Robeson initiated his international artistic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with a theatrical role in Great Britain, settling in London for the next several years with his wife Essie.\nRobeson next appeared as Othello at the Savoy Theatre before becoming an international cinematic star through roles in Show Boat and Sanders of the River. He became increasingly attuned towards the sufferings of other cultures and peoples. Acting against advice, which warned of his economic ruin if he became politically active, he set aside his theatrical career to advocate the cause of the Republican forces of the Spanish Civil War. He then became active in the Council on African Affairs (CAA).\nDuring World War II, he supported America's war efforts and won accolades for his portrayal of Othello on Broadway. However, his history of supporting pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the FBI. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations and Robeson was investigated during the age of McCarthyism. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy of pro-Soviet policies, he was denied a passport by the U.S. State Department, and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to Harlem and published a periodical critical of US policies. His right to travel was eventually restored by Kent v. Dulles, but his health broke down. He retired and he lived out the remaining years of his life privately in Philadelphia.", "r_dbid": "62db8a23ee14d50331db1c4e", "r_user": "192.149.97.2", "s_page": "Paul Robeson", "s_revid": "4688085",

Before becoming governor, he had been a Republican politician in Idaho for 30 years, serving in the Idaho Legislature (Idaho House of Representatives 1965-67, Idaho Senate 1967-79) and as the 35th Lieutenant Governor of Idaho from 1979 to 1983. He ran for governor in 1982 and was defeated in a close race by the Democratic incumbent, John V. Evans. Future U.S Senator and Governor Dirk Kempthorne served as his campaign manager.\nAfter rebuilding the Idaho Republican Party into near-total dominance as party chairman in the early 1990s, Batt re-entered electoral politics. In 1994, Batt won the Republican gubernatorial primary with 48% of the vote, and defeated the Democratic candidate, State Attorney General Larry EchoHawk, in the general election 52% to 44%. Despite polls putting his popularity at around 80%, he chose to serve only one term.\nAmong Batt's more notable accomplishments as governor were pushing through worker's compensation for agricultural workers and negotiating a pact limiting nuclear waste storage in Idaho.

A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, this is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes. The term\" scripting language\" is also used loosely to refer to dynamic high-level general-purpose languages, such as Perl, Tcl, and Python, with the term\" script\" often used for small programs(up to a few thousand lines of code) in such languages, or in domain-specific languages such as the text-processing languages sed and AWK. Some of these languages were originally developed for use within a particular environment, and later developed into portable domain-specific or general-purpose languages. Conversely, many general-purpose languages have dialects that are used as scripting languages. This article discusses scripting languages in the narrow sense of languages for a specific environment. The spectrum of scripting languages ranges from very small and highly domain-specific languages to general-purpose programming languages used for scripting. Standard examples of scripting languages for specific environments include: Bash, for the Unix or Unix-like operating systems; ECMAScript(JavaScript), for web browsers; and Visual Basic for Applications, for Microsoft Office applications. Lua is a language designed and widely used as an extension language. Python is a general-purpose language that is also commonly used as an extension language, while ECMAScript is still primarily a scripting language for web browsers, but is also used as a general-purpose language. The Emacs Lisp dialect of Lisp(for the Emacs editor) and the Visual Basic for Applications dialect of Visual Basic are examples of scripting language dialects of general-purpose languages. Some game systems, notably the Second Life virtual world and the Trainz franchise of Railroad simulators have been extensively extended in functionality by scripting extensions. In other games like Wesnoth, the variety of actual games played by players are scripts written by other users.", "N_words": 437, "BI": "O", "idx": 3}], "split": "gold_test"}, {"_id": "6365b6dfd33a081ae9117530", "r_page": "Ajmer", "r_revid": 1035880396, "r_content": "Ajmer pronounced\u00a0[\u0259d\u0292me\u02d0r] (listen) is one of the major and oldest cities in the Indian state of Rajasthan and the centre of the eponymous Ajmer District.

During the war, France and its client states under Napoleon I defeated an alliance, the Third Coalition, made up of the Holy Roman Empire, Russia, Britain and others.\nBritain had already been at war with France following the resumption of hostilities resulting from the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens and remained the only country still at war with France after the Treaty of Pressburg. From 1803\u201305, Britain stood under constant threat of a French invasion. The Royal Navy, however, secured mastery of the seas and decisively destroyed a Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805.\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804\u201305 as Napoleon's actions in Italy (crowning himself with the Iron Crown of Lombardy) and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the Grande Arm\u00e9e lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Russo-Austrian force under Tsar Alexander I at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\nOn 26 December 1805, Austria and France signed the Treaty of Pressburg, which took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition, while it reinforced the earlier treaties between the two powers of Campo Formio and of Lun\u00e9ville. The treaty confirmed the Austrian cession of lands in Italy and Bavaria to France and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies, imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs, and allowed the defeated Russian troops free passage, with their arms and equipment, through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Victory at Austerlitz also permitted the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and central Europe. As a direct consequence of these events, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist when, in 1806, Holy Roman Emperor Francis\u00a0II abdicated the Imperial throne, emerging as Francis I, Emperor of Austria. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose armies protected Sicily from a French invasion, to settle. Meanwhile, Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.", "r_dbid": "62dbaa65ee14d50331eea77e", "r_user": "81.131.27.220", "s_page": "War of the Third Coalition", "s_revid": "6213802", "s_content": "The War of the Third Coalition was a European War from the years 1803 to 1806.

The most famous version of the Great Commission is in Matthew 28:16\u201320, where on a mountain in Galilee Jesus calls on his followers to make disciples of and baptize all nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\nThe Great Commission is similar to the episodes of the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles found in the other Synoptic Gospels, though with significant differences. Luke also has Jesus dispatching disciples during his ministry, sending them to all the nations and giving them power over demons, including the seventy disciples. The dispersion of the Apostles in the traditional ending of Mark is thought to be a 2nd-century summary based on Matthew and Luke.\nIt has become a tenet in Christian theology emphasizing ministry, missionary work, evangelism, and baptism. The apostles are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and founded the apostolic sees. Preterists believe that the Great Commission and other Bible prophecies were fulfilled in the 1st century while futurists believe Bible prophecy is yet to be fulfilled at the Second Coming.\nSome researchers of the historical Jesus[who?] see the Great Commission as reflecting not Jesus' words but rather the Christian community in which each gospel was written. John Dominic Crossan says that Jesus did commission the apostles during his lifetime, as reported in the Gospels. Others,[who?] however, see even these lesser commissions as representing Christian invention rather than history.", "r_dbid": "62dbbb2fee14d50331f60a0f", "r_user": "Hardyplants", "s_page": "Great Commission", "s_revid": "6924920", "s_content": "The Great Commission in Christian belief is something that Jesus told his followers.

He tells them to make disciples of and baptize everyone in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nEarlier Jesus had sent out 70 of his followers to preach and heal, but only to the Jews. However, Jesus himself had healed some non-Jewish people before. At the beginning of his public work, Jesus spoke to His own people.

The committee name was changed to the Committee on Education and Labor on February 14, 1870, when petitions relating to labor were added to their jurisdiction from the Committee on Naval Affairs.\nThe committee\u2019s jurisdiction at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on issues relating to federal employees\u2019 working conditions and federal education aid. Prominent issues considered by the committee in the 1910s and 1920s included the creation of a minimum wage, the establishments of a Department of Labor, a Department of Education, and a Children\u2019s Bureau. During the 1930s, the committee took action on the National Labor Relations Act, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act of 1936 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\nIn 1944, the jurisdiction of the Public Health Service was transferred from the Commerce Committee over to the Committee on Education and Labor, resulting in the committee taking over issues relating to public health matters. The name of the committee changed during the 80th Congress to the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, which was part of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (Public Law 79-601). As part of this bill, the jurisdiction of the committee was expanded to include the issues of rehabilitation, health, and education of veterans. Mine safety legislation was also added to the committee\u2019s jurisdiction in 1949.\nDuring the Johnson Administration, the committee established itself as the principal committee for the legislation pertaining to the War on Poverty, as part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Through the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-510), certain issues pertaining to veterans were transferred to the newly created Committee on Veterans Affairs. In the 95th Congress, the Senate passed S. Res. 4 which renamed the committee to be the Committee on Human Resources. However, the name was again changed in the 96th Congress in S.

He previously served as Ollanta Humala's Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015, and Prime Minister from April 2015 to July 2016.\nBorn in the capital city of Lima in 1958, Cateriano pursued a law degree at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, specializing in constitutional law. During his brief term in the Peruvian Congress between 1990 and 1992, Cateriano attained a prominent role as a ranking member of the congressional investigative committee on Alan Garc\u00eda's first administration (1985-1990). Alongside Lourdes Flores and Fernando Olivera, the committee was ultimately disbanded following Garc\u00eda's acquittal by the Supreme Court in March 1992. Cateriano published in the following years a detailed work on the investigation.\nAfter a failed run for the Peruvian Congress, Cateriano worked extensively in opposition to Alberto Fujimori's presidency, ultimately being appointed to the Constitutional Reform Advisory Body of the Ministry of Justice in the presidency of Valent\u00edn Paniagua. Subsequently, he was appointed under Alejandro Toledo's presidency as Deputy Minister of Justice, serving until his resignation in June 2002, alongside minister and former colleague, Fernando Olivera.\nDuring the presidency of Ollanta Humala, Cateriano served as Minister of Defense from July 2012 to April 2015. In his almost three-year tenure, he remained a controversial member of Humala's administration, constantly clashing with the opposition regarding the government's modus operandi, in which First Lady Nadine Heredia seemingly interfered with government decisions. He also faced criticism for his support of pecuniary sanctions on voluntary military service enrollment, which the Constitutional Court declared the measure unconstitutional. Upon the resignation of Ana Jara on 2 April 2015, due to her censorship by the Peruvian Congress regarding illegal government espionage under her management as Prime Minister of Peru, Cateriano was appointed as her successor. Seemed by pundits as a government loyalist, he served through the end of Humala's presidency.\nCateriano was sworn as Prime Minister of Peru on 15 July 2020, succeeding Vicente Zeballos as the government faces strong criticism due to Vizcarra's management of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru.", "r_dbid": "62d1755670a3472b808e9968", "r_user": "", "s_page": "Pedro Cateriano", "s_revid": "7035387", "s_content": "Pedro \u00c1lvaro Cateriano Bellido (born June 26, 1958) is a Peruvian lawyer and politician.

Since 1 January 2011 it has been part of the municipality of Medemblik.\nAbout the origin of its name Wervershoof are a number of versions. For many, the naming to the homestead of the most popular preacher Werenfridus. Werenfridus was follower of Willibrord and came to the area in 690 to the word of Willibrord and his gospel. He then lived in a farm in later Wervershoof.\nThe place is in exile in 1288 Werfaertshof mentioned on a map. But the story of Werenfridus still has many followers. Also, both as a parish church dedicated to St. Werenfridus. The church that once stood was dedicated to him.\nThe population fluctuated between 250 and 400. The number grew in 1817 after it became an independent municipality. In 1868 there were nearly 800 inhabitants. The municipality was then enlarged with High and Low Zwaagdijk and then had about 1600 inhabitants. The village remained a time approximately equal in population.

Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batsman out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket, but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman's body (except the hand holding the bat). The umpire's decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.\nLeg before wicket first appeared in the laws of cricket in 1774, as batsmen began to use their pads to prevent the ball hitting their wicket. Over several years, refinements were made to clarify where the ball should pitch and to remove the element of interpreting the batsman's intentions. The 1839 version of the law used a wording that remained in place for nearly 100 years. However, from the latter part of the 19th century, batsmen became increasingly expert at \"pad-play\" to reduce the risk of their dismissal. Following a number of failed proposals for reform, in 1935 the law was expanded, such that batsmen could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump. Critics felt this change made the game unattractive as it encouraged negative tactics at the expense of leg spin bowling.\nAfter considerable debate and various experiments, the law was changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, which is used to this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.\nIn his 1995 survey of cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb states: \"No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days\". Owing to its complexity, the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators, administrators and commentators; lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble. Since the law's introduction, the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years. Statistics reveal that the probability of a batsman being dismissed lbw in a Test match varies depending on where the match is played and which teams are playing.", "r_dbid": "62d1004811049d02261d1b4e", "r_user": "Mikemyers345", "s_page": "Leg before wicket", "s_revid": "7232881", "s_content": "Leg before wicket (LBW) is one way a batsman can get out in cricket.

Flood damage modelling was limited to local, regional or national scales. However, with the presence of climate change and an increase in the population rates, flood events have intensified and called for a global interest in finding out different methods with both spatial and temporal dynamics.\nThe seawater can flood the land via several different paths: direct flooding, overtopping of a barrier, breaching of a barrier.\nCoastal flooding is largely a natural event, however human influence on the coastal environment can exacerbate coastal flooding. Extraction of water from groundwater reservoirs in the coastal zone can instigate subsidence of the land, thus increasing the risk of flooding. Engineered protection structures along the coast such as sea walls alter the natural processes of the beach, often leading to erosion on adjacent stretches of the coast which also increases the risk of flooding. Moreover, sea level rise and extreme weather caused by climate change will increase the intensity and amount of coastal flooding affecting hundreds of millions of people.", "r_dbid": "62d0ddb111049d02261c498c", "r_user": "EMsmile", "s_page": "Coastal flooding", "s_revid": "7431143", "s_content": "Coastal flooding happens when dry and low-lying land is submerged by water.

Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was referred to as the NASCAR Winston Cup Series (1971\u20132003). A similar deal was made with Nextel in 2003, and it became the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series (2004\u20132007). Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, and in 2008 the series was renamed the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (2008\u20132016). In December 2016, it was announced that Monster Energy would become the new title sponsor and the series was renamed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (2017\u20132019). In 2019, NASCAR rejected Monster's offer to extend the current naming rights deal beyond the end of the season. NASCAR subsequently announced its move to a new tiered sponsorship model beginning with the 2020 season similar to other US based professional sports leagues, where it was simply known as the NASCAR Cup Series, with the sponsors of the series being called Premier Partners. The four Premier Partners are Busch Beer, Coca-Cola, GEICO, and Xfinity.\nThe championship is determined by a points system, with points being awarded according to finish placement and number of laps led. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 26 races, 16 drivers, selected primarily on the basis of wins during the first 26 races, are seeded based on their total number of wins. They compete in the last ten races, where the difference in points is greatly minimized. This is called the NASCAR playoffs.\nThe series holds strong roots in the Southeastern United States, with about half of the races in the 36-race season being held in that region. As of 2020[update] the schedule includes tracks from around the United States. Regular season races were previously held in Canada, and exhibition races were held in Japan and Australia. The Daytona 500, the most prestigious race, had a television audience of about 9.17\u00a0million U.S. viewers in 2019.\nCup Series cars are unique in automobile racing. The engines are powerful enough to reach speeds of over 200\u00a0mph (320\u00a0km/h), but their weight coupled with a relatively simple aerodynamic package (based on the body styles of cars currently available for retail sale in the United States) make for poor handling.

It was ruled by the Rurik dynasty, who had ruled Rus' since the foundation of Novgorod in 862. Ivan III the Great titled himself as Grand Prince of all Rus'.\nThe state originated with the rule of Alexander Nevsky of the Rurik dynasty, when in 1263 his son Daniel I was appointed to rule the newly-created Grand Principality of Moscow, which was a vassal state to the Mongol Empire (under the \"Tatar Yoke\"), and which had eclipsed and eventually absorbed its parent duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal by the 1320s. It later annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1478 and conquered the Grand Duchy of Tver in 1485, and ultimately remained vassal state of the Golden Horde until 1480, though there were frequent uprisings and successful military campaigns against the Mongols, such as the war of Dmitri Donskoi in 1380.\nMuscovites, Suzdalians and other inhabitants of the Rus' principality were able to maintain their Slavic, pagan, and Orthodox traditions for the most part under the Tatar Yoke. Ivan III further consolidated the state during his 43-year reign, campaigning against his major remaining rival power, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and by 1503 he had tripled the territory of his realm, adopting the title of tsar and claiming the title of \"Ruler of all Rus'\". By his marriage to Sophia Palaiologina, niece of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor, he claimed Muscovy to be the successor state of the Roman Empire, the \"Third Rome\". The emigration of Byzantine people influenced and strengthened Moscow's identity as the heir of Orthodox traditions. Ivan's successor Vasili III also enjoyed military success, gaining Smolensk from Lithuania in 1512 and pushing Muscovy's borders to the Dniepr River. Vasili's son Ivan IV (later known as Ivan the Terrible) was an infant upon his father's death in 1533. He was crowned in 1547, assuming the title of tsar together with the proclamation of the Tsardom of Russia (Russian: \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0420\u0443\u0441c\u043a\u043e\u0435, Tsarstvo Russkoye).", "r_dbid": "62d2827f11049d022625d1af", "r_user": "Lembit Staan", "s_page": "Grand Duchy of Moscow", "s_revid": "8091964", "s_content": "The Grand Duchy of Moscow, Muscovite Russia, Muscovite Rus' or Grand Principality of Moscow (Russian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435, romanized:\u00a0Velikoye knyazhestvo Moskovskoye; or Muscovy in English from the Latin Moscovia) was a principality in Rus'.

Pernik is the most populated town in western Bulgaria after Sofia. It is the main town of Pernik Province and lies on both banks of the Struma River in the Pernik Valley between the Golo Bardo Mountain, Vitosha Mountain, Lyulin and Viskyar mountains.\nPernik is the principal town of Pernik Province \u2013 a province in western Bulgaria, which is next to the Serbian border.\nOriginally the site of a Thracian fortress founded in the 4th century BC, and later a Roman settlement, Pernik became part of the Bulgarian Empire in the early 9th century as an important fortress. The medieval town was a key Bulgarian stronghold during Bulgarian tsar Samuil's wars against the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century, when it was governed by the local noble Krakra of Pernik, withstanding Byzantine sieges a number of times.\nFrom 1396 until 1878 the town was under Ottoman rule. In the 20th century Pernik developed rapidly as a centre for coal mining and heavy industry. During the Communist rule of Bulgaria it was called Dimitrovo between 1949 and 1962 after Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov.\nThe Surva International Festival of the Masquerade Games (simply called Surva) is held in the town every January. Surva is an International Kukeri Festival in Pernik, Bulgaria and is one of the biggest masquerade festival on the Balkans and Eastern Europe. It is held in the last three days of January each year.\nEconomically Pernik is an industrial town. Industry is of vital importance for the economy of the province. Pernik is the major manufacturing centre, one of the largest in the country with the Stomana steel complex; heavy machinery (mining and industrial equipment); brown coals, building materials and textiles being the most important.
